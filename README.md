i2C-El-Zede is project, created for OPC users (e.g. the Raspberry PI, Orange
PI, etc.). El-Zede is designed to be a command line interface tool, which
allows you to control your externally connected I2C LCD moduls, like an 
Adafruit 20x4.

The program is currently in design state, so it is not working right now.
